## Section 4: BIND Configuration Introduction


#### The BIND Server uses port 53 but according to its developers is can switch to other ports according to its present needs and operation. BIND gives you some flexible choices. The two initial choices to run its software are:

### 4.1. As a caching name server

(or)

### 4.2. As an authoritative name server
#### Authoritarive name servers is when you have all your static ip addresses reversed to your domain(s). Since in this scenario you have the authoridade under your domain, you can setup your slave servers with their respective encryption keys to communication with each other and exchange update information of your TTL domanin zones.

### 4.3. As a Public and Free Recursive Resolvers.
#### These are Public DNS like Google, 8.8.8.8, IBM Warp, 9.9.9.9, Cloudflare/APNIC, 1.1.1.1, OpenDNS.org, OpenNic.org, https://www.opennic.org/, https://servers.opennic.org/

### 4.4. Internal Recursive resolver for your catching internal network.
#### Your catching name server will be `a recursive resolver for your internal network` but `will NOT offer to recurse to your external network`. **This is a very important security measure** you must understand when configuring your DNS Server. `Remember, you will not give recursion to your external views/external network`.

###### Name Configuration Example:

```
// www.external zones
//
view "external" {
	match-clients { ... Server ip addresses related to your network
  	};
	recursion no;
//
```

#### You will find this statement on your ```/etc/named.conf``` file. I will give you an example of this file down in this section.

```How that translates on Webmin configuration?```

### 4.1. A caching name server. What are the limitations?
#### A caching name server is the one where you do not have authority over your external zones but you do have the authority under your internal zone and domain. Catching name servers are the cheapest form of having a server and are great to provide glues under your domain zone structure while helping you to serve and manage your domain zones. In a caching name, the server relies on your Registrar for support to serve your domain zones and you do not need to (necessarily) reverse your ip address to your domain name. Your registrar (domain host) will have the primary and secondary authority under your domain. However, since you own your domain and pay your Registrar for hosting, you will have the authority to configure and setup your domain zones.

### 4.2. An authoritative name server
#### An authoritative name server, as the name says, allows you to have the primary and secondary authority under your domain and zones internally (LAN) and externally (WAN). In this scenery, you must buy some ip addresses to set up your domain zone structure in which includes configuring your (NS), name server and reversing these ips to your domain name servers, NS, subdomains, or email servers. This is the ideal configuration to run an eCommerce store or any other application of your choice.

#### According to the BIND rules, to have a server, you must have at `least 2 computers` in different locations running BIND. That means you can have one connection going with the ISP AT&T and the other going with ISP Comcast in two different locations. The reason for this advice is that in case of one of your connections goes down, your domain structure will still alive on the internet. It is an emergency backup plan in the face of unexpected situations like a natural or intentional disaster like fire, floods, computer malfunction or cybersecurity attacks.

#### *NOTE:* However, it is possible to run your server with one location (not advisable). You will have to expend some few bucks and buy a battery backup for electrical power blackouts. I had a few electrical blackouts happing in San Francisco related to a storm weather/electrical transformers burn out.

#### Having a server requires some responsibility for the maintenance of hardware and software updates. It also requires that one keep themselves abreast with the latest technology.

#### The biggest issue of running a server, it is not running the server but dealing with the everyday cybersecurity issues. The Internet is full of bozos. Be ready to face the bozos.

### After you had installed BIND, here is the location of your files on the OS X.

#### For more information how to install BIND on OSX,

[https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00312](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00312)


````

To summarize your BIND configuration, there are a total of 4 files that must be created (it is not there already) in the /etc directory for BIND to start.

1. rndc.conf
2. named.conf
3. rndc.key
4. named.iscdlv.key

5. The firth one is your logs and that file should be present in ```/var/log/named/named.log```

6. Are your Zones files! These also will have to be created. The location of your TTL Zone files is ```/var/named```

````

### Therefore, let's start...

1. If not there, after your Bind installation, you will have to create the ```rndc.conf``` file on the /etc directory.


```[admin:~] root# nano /etc/rndc.conf```  ... press the return key.

inside of this file, you will have to paste these contents;


````

# Start of rndc.conf
key "rndc-key" {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "uvceheVuqf17ZwIcTydddw==";
};

options {
        default-key "rndc-key";
        default-server 127.0.0.1;
        default-port 953;
};
# End of rndc.conf


# Use with the following in named.conf, adjusting the allow list as needed:
# key "rndc-key" {
#       algorithm hmac-md5;
#       secret "uvceheVuqf17ZwIcTydddw==";
# };
#
# controls {
#       inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
#               allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
# };
# End of named.conf

````


2. After this file has been created and it is in place, as root, you will issue this command to get your new keycode;

```[admin:~] root# sudo rndc-confgen > /etc/rndc.conf```

After you had issued this command, your new key code will be present inside of the rndc.conf file. You are going to open this file and copy this new code and paste in your named.conf file also located on the /etc/ directory. Here are some helpful commands to accomplish that...

```[admin:~] root# nano /etc/named.conf```

```[admin:~] root# nano /etc/rndc.key``` 

```[admin:~] root# nano /etc/named.iscdlv.key```


3. Here is an example of the ```named.conf``` file where you will paste your new rndc-key;


````

// named.conf file starts

//Include keys file

key rndc-key {
	algorithm hmac-md5;
	secret "uvceheVuqf17ZwIcTydddw==";
	};

// Declares control channels to be used by the rndc utility.
// It is recommended that 127.0.0.1 be the only address used.
// This also allows non-privileged users on the local host to manage
// your name server.
// Default controls

controls {
	inet 127.0.0.1 port 953 allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { rndc-key; };

        //
         // If there is a firewall between you and name servers you want
         // to talk to, you might need to un-comment the query-source
         // directive below.  Previous versions of BIND always asked

5. To create your named.log, You must create the named directory first so,


```[admin:~] root# cd /var/log``` return


```[admin:/var/log] root# mkdir named``` return


```[admin:~] root# nano /var/log/named/named.log``` return


```Command O, return, Command x```


6. Next, you will be creating your TTL Zones files inside of the ```/var/named``` directory. Since I gave you already an example of the named.conf, I will give an example for each zone present there.

Therefore, by order, the first zone is ```named.ca```. This file should be updated when it is appropriate by downloading from ```ftp.internic.net```

You create your Zone files the same way I explained how to create files before using the terminal as root and issuing the commands I show you before.


The name of this file is ```named.ca```

On BIND, for every ```forward zone``` you will have a correspondent ```reverse zone```.
Observe and study this file, because there is a meaning in every session of it. Observe that the domain, localhost always has a "." in the end and ip addresses do not. Everything on BIND is case sensitive. If you forget a "." BIND will not start.
```TTL``` means Time To Live. ```SOA``` means Start Of Authority.


Here is the ```named.local```  reverse zone

That first roll of numbers starting with 2019.. is the file number and that is the proper way to write it. Year, Month, Day, Number. Every time you make a change in the Zone file, you will have to update the number for that change to take an effect. Example:
2019120300
If you make a change in the file, you will have to update the file number to;
2019120301

The next zone file by order is the ```loopback.v6```

## Section 4: BIND Configuration Introduction


#### The BIND Server uses port 53 but according to its developers is can switch to other ports according to its present needs and operation. BIND gives you some flexible choices. The two initial choices to run its software are:

### 4.1. As a caching name server

(or)

### 4.2. As an authoritative name server
#### Authoritarive name servers is when you have all your static ip addresses reversed to your domain(s). Since in this scenario you have the authoridade under your domain, you can setup your slave servers with their respective encryption keys to communication with each other and exchange update information of your TTL domanin zones.

### 4.3. As a Public and Free Recursive Resolvers.
#### These are Public DNS like Google, 8.8.8.8, IBM Warp, 9.9.9.9, Cloudflare/APNIC, 1.1.1.1, OpenDNS.org, OpenNic.org, https://www.opennic.org/, https://servers.opennic.org/

### 4.4. Internal Recursive resolver for your catching internal network.
#### Your catching name server will be `a recursive resolver for your internal network` but `will NOT offer to recurse to your external network`. **This is a very important security measure** you must understand when configuring your DNS Server. `Remember, you will not give recursion to your external views/external network`.

###### Name Configuration Example:

```
// www.external zones
//
view "external" {
	match-clients { ... Server ip addresses related to your network
  	};
	recursion no;
//
```

```How that translates on Webmin configuration?```

### 4.1. A caching name server. What are the limitations?
#### A caching name server is the one where you do not have authority over your external zones but you do have the authority under your internal zone and domain. Catching name servers are the cheapest form of having a server and are great to provide glues under your domain zone structure while helping you to serve and manage your domain zones. In a caching name, the server relies on your Registrar for support to serve your domain zones and you do not need to (necessarily) reverse your ip address to your domain name. Your registrar (domain host) will have the primary and secondary authority under your domain. However, since you own your domain and pay your Registrar for hosting, you will have the authority to configure and setup your domain zones.

### 4.2. An authoritative name server
#### An authoritative name server, as the name says, allows you to have the primary and secondary authority under your domain and zones internally (LAN) and externally (WAN). In this scenery, you must buy some ip addresses to set up your domain zone structure in which includes configuring your (NS), name server and reversing these ips to your domain name servers, NS, subdomains, or email servers. This is the ideal configuration to run an eCommerce store or any other application of your choice.

#### According to the BIND rules, to have a server, you must have at `least 2 computers` in different locations running BIND. That means you can have one connection going with the ISP AT&T and the other going with ISP Comcast in two different locations. The reason for this advice is that in case of one of your connections goes down, your domain structure will still alive on the internet. It is an emergency backup plan in the face of unexpected situations like a natural or intentional disaster like fire, floods, computer malfunction or cybersecurity attacks.

#### *NOTE:* However, it is possible to run your server with one location (not advisable). You will have to expend some few bucks and buy a battery backup for electrical power blackouts. I had a few electrical blackouts happing in San Francisco related to a storm weather/electrical transformers burn out.

#### Having a server requires some responsibility for the maintenance of hardware and software updates. It also requires that one keep themselves abreast with the latest technology.

#### The biggest issue of running a server, it is not running the server but dealing with the everyday cybersecurity issues. The Internet is full of bozos. Be ready to face the bozos.

### After you had installed BIND, here is the location of your files on the OS X.

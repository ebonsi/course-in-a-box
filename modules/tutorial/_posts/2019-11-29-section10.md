#### The easiest way to get your Certificate of Authority SSL, is through Homebrew and Certbot. Install Homebrew first, then through Homebrew you install Certbot.

### Homebrew website can be accessed through this link;

[https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

**Warning:** Do not attempt to install Homebrew as root. The proper way to install Homebrew is through a regular Admin account.

To install Homebrew, open the terminal as a regular Admin and paste this link;

   ````admin:~ admin$/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"````

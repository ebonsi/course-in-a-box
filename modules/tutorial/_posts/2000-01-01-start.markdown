# Why I Developed this Course

I have been running a home server for a long time and during this time I accumulated some knowledge on the subject. So, now I decided to share this knowledge with you. By reading and researching books and the internet I encounter much good information and by reading their material, I would go on the try. I went through many tests. In the beginning, was hard because many used to say that you need a static ip address to run a server. However, at some point, I got to run a server on a dynamic address. I had an internet connection with Pacific Bell/SBC. Researching I found a little application that would change the ip address when there was a change in the DHCP ISP gateway. It worked ok for while until AT&T merged with Pacific Bell and started to offer a DSL/Uverse connection with a static ip address. That made my work a lot easier and with one ip address, I got to serve 3 websites plus one eCommerce store. 

 - a tutorial module to guide you through the technical steps for creating your course.

### Why I Developed this Course?

#### I have been running a home server for a long time and during this time I accumulated some knowledge on the subject. So, now I decided to share this knowledge with you. By reading and researching books and the internet I encountered lots of good information and after reading their material, I went on and try. ###

#### I went through many tests. In the beginning, it was hard because many used to say that you need a static ip address to run a server. However, at some point, I got to run a server on a dynamic address.

#### I had an internet connection with Pacific Bell/SBC. Researching more on the subject, I found a little application that would change the ip address when there was a change in the source DHCP ISP gateway. To make my dynamic connection work, in the past, I used OpenDNS with OpenDNS Updater.

#### ***Note*** that to make this work you also have to setup your Network Stack with the **openDNS Servers,** **208.67.222.222 Â· 208.67.220.220.** It is good because they're very conciencious about security and their DNS offers a gateway for that. OpenDNS has been aquired by CISCO and we all hope their structure will remain current or better than was before. We will see. This configuration worked ok for while! Then, AT&T merged with Pacific Bell and started to offer a `DSL/Uverse` connection with a `static ip address`. That made my work a lot easier and with one ip address, I got to serve 3 websites plus one eCommerce store. The eCommerce store was only a test store but had all the features of a real store in production. I do not advise people to run an eCommerce store in production without having a reverse ip address. Some savy costumers will check that and if your ip address do not reverse properly to your domain name, they get suspicious about. In addition to that, hackers will try everything in their book to high-jack your domain. So, you have to wach out that your store does not become a haven to intruders. 

#### Today, you will find many other services that offers dynamic connections. You can research on Free Dynamic DNS to find others out there in the internet.

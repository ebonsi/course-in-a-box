# Section 9: About the Software | Apache Configuration

#### When you first install Mamp Apache MySQL, what you end up is with their ```original configuration```. That is the reason I previously created this directory on the installation directory. You will be going to grab the directory ```conf``` from the ```/local/apac/Apache2/``` and drop in the ```original configuration``` directory and thus do a backup of this directory. In the next steps you will be creating your ```new``` ```conf``` directory that will connect the Apache2 Server to your network and services on the Mac OS X. That includes your ```domain1``` user and all the other essential Apache conf files located on the ```extra``` directory.

#### In the Apache configuration section we will edit the ```conf``` directory. The ```conf``` directory of Apache you will find the main ```httpd.conf``` file and the sub-directory, called ```extra```! Inside of the ```extra``` sub-directory you will find these files:

````
1. httpd-ssl.conf

2. httpd-userdir.conf

3. httpd-vhosts.conf

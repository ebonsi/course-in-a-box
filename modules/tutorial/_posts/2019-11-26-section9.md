# Section 9: About the Software | Apache Configuration

#### When you first install Mamp Apache MySQL, what you end up is with their ```original configuration```. That is the reason I previously created this directory on the installation directory. You will be going to grab the directory ```conf``` from the ```/local/apac/Apache2/``` and drop in the ```original configuration``` directory and thus do a backup of this directory. In the next steps you will be creating your ```new``` ```conf``` directory that will connect the Apache2 Server to your network and services on the Mac OS X. That includes your ```domain1``` user and all the other essential Apache conf files located on the ```extra``` directory.

#### After you have copied the ```conf``` original directory, we will be creating a directory named ```users``` inside of the ```conf``` directory of the Apache2 recently installed directory. So, head to the terminal and issue these commands;

```[admin:~] root# cd /usr/local/apac/Apache2/conf``` 

```[admin:/usr/local/apac/Apache2/conf] root# mkdir users```

#### Then create your user file named ```domain1.conf``` inside of the recently created directory ```users```. Here are the commands;

```[admin:~] root# nano /usr/local/apac/Apache2/conf/users/domain1.conf``` 

```pressing return```

#### will open a blank file on the terminal. In this file, you will be writing these codes,

````
<Directory "/Users/domain1/Sites/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

````
#### That is it! After that, press,

```Control O``` ```return``` This is Control Letter O and not Zero, ok? Then,

```Control x``` to exit and go back to root.

#### Now you can see that your file ```domain1.conf``` has been created inside of the ```users``` directory.

#### In the Apache configuration section we will edit the ```conf``` directory. The ```conf``` directory of Apache you will find the main ```httpd.conf``` file and the sub-directory, called ```extra```! Inside of the ```extra``` sub-directory you will find these files:

````
1. httpd-ssl.conf

2. httpd-userdir.conf

3. httpd-vhosts.conf

````

#### Next we will be editing the ```httpd.conf``` file located inside of the ```Apache2/conf``` directory. This is a big file, so you will have to take your time and follow it's configuration step-by-step.

# Section 7: About the Software | Mac OS X Network Stack Configuration

#### Before you start this process, you should seat down and think how are you going to design your network. What LAN subnet you will going to choose to host your domain and ip addresses. If you have not bridged your Router, you can find all this information in your Internet ISP Router.

#### Subnets goes from Class A, B and C.

```
    Class A = 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
    Class B = 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
    Class C = 192.0.1.0 to 223.255.255.0
```

#### A link to learn a little bit more of these network classes are here bellow but do not be too hang out on their technical issues. I will explain that to you later and you will learn as you go by doing and observing the network. All the other technical issues you will learn with time.

### Learning the basics of Subnetting:

#### Straight forward, you will follow the same sub-net assigned by your ISP modem/router.

### The first step...

#### Is to start to create your domain account on your Mac. Click on System Preferences and open the accounts panel and create your first account for hosting your domain. Try to give a name that is associated with your domain. Ex. if your domain is "martusa.com" your account most likely will have the name "martusa". Keep things simple and logic!

![System Preferences > Accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/img/network-stack-01.png)

### The Second Step...

#### Is to create your domain account. Click on Users&Groups and create your domain account! Note that your domain account is just a simple account without any admin privileges. 

![System Preferences > Accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/img/network-stack-02.png)

#### After you have created your domain account, Go back to the System Preferences Main Panel and Click on Network. Refer to pict number one. After that, you are going to create your first Network Stack.

#### As I am writing this, there are some changes in the configuration of one of my servers. I have upgraded Server 1 to Mojave! Sever 2 and 3 still running on Mavericks. On Maverick it seems that one needs to specify their network services one by one.

#### The configuration of the Network Stack on Mojave is simple. I am no longer need to assign each service stack to the correspondent domain. I just assigned the main domain and its (NS), name servers and let all the other domains work through the Apache Virtual Host Configuration.

**NOte** Do not worry if this is just Vulcan talk to you! You will be able to understand this configuration at a later time when you start to install and configure the virtual hosts on Apache.

### The Third Step...

#### After you have created your domain account, Go back to the System Preferences Main Panel and click on Network. Refer to pict number one. Then, start to create your network services for each domain you intent to host.

#### On Mavericks, this will allow you to contact your website from your intranet. To be able to test if your site is working, you will have to use Tor as your browser. Refer to [https://www.torproject.org/](https://www.torproject.org/){:target="_blank"}. Tor will relay outside of your intranet and attempt to contact your website from one of their relay locations around the world.

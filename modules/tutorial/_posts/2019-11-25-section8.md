# Section 8 About the Software | The Apache Server

## The next software is nothing more than the resilient Apache Server. It also dispenses any commentary, you must use to appreciate its features.

#### [https://httpd.apache.org/](https://httpd.apache.org/)

#### The Apache Server can be installed through Webmin or by downloading a Mamp Package from Bitnami or through Homebrew.

#### We will cover the Bitnami package installation and configuration (as root) on port 80 and port 443. Note that I will be supplying a PDF file with the step-by-step images. The advantage of PDF file over the web is that you can enlarge the picture to see text and images without loosing it's sharpness.

#### The Mamp package comes with both Apache and MySQL and the installation of both can be done in one single shoot.

#### Before downloading the Mamp package, please take some time to prepare your hard drive so you will understand the structure configuration and storage of your new installation.

#### I am giving you an example to follow on the image below but you can create your own and do any way you want. You might think is too much but over time and dealing with software testing and installations you will be thankful to follow some type of organizational structure and you won't get lost looking for things when you upgrade in the future. Note that the directory structure of your installation will have from beginning to end...

#### Bitnami native installers automate the setup of a Bitnami application stack on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. Each installer includes all of the software necessary to run out of the box (the stack). The process is simple; just download, click next-next-next and you are done!

#### Try, test and work with the application in your local environment or as a root installation. Our installers are self contained. They don't interfere with other software on your system 

#### Download installers for Bitnami MAMP Stack, head yourself to Bitnami MAMP Stack Installers For Windows, Mac or Linux...

#### Note: You do not need to sign in or open a free account. You can head straight to the download area.

#### After you have finished downloading the software, move the package to the proper directory, in this case, the,

#### Now, is time for you to open the terminal and log as root! If you missed or forgot this, go back to Section 6. At the beginning of Section 6, you will find the instructions on how to log as root.

#### [Section 6, About the Mac OS X Terminal](https://ebonsi.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/tutorial/section6/)

#### Double click on the Mamp Bitnami package will open the program. Note how your directories are organized and opened in the image below.

#### You have the terminal on the left where you are on root mode, the super administrator plus the Mamp package now opened. On the right you have both directories opened. One point to the Mamp package. The other is showing the package opened and showing on the Mac OS X main admin home directory. Refer to the image below,

#### The next step, you will hold the keyboard ```Control ``` and press on the ```Mamp Icon Package``` as it shows in the image below. Pressing on the Mamp icon, a dialog box will come up pointing you to the...

#### ```Show Package Contents```

![Click on Show Package Contents]({{site.baseurl}}/img/apache-installation-1280px-005.png)

#### Drive your cursor to the file ```installbuilder.sh```, grab this file and drop inside of the root terminal window and press ```return``` in your keyboard will start the installation process. Refer to the image below, 

![Drag Installbuilder.sh to terminal]({{site.baseurl}}/img/apache-installation-1280px-006.png)

### Now, stop the installation process for a moment!

#### Because you are going to open a new terminal window, log as root in this terminal window and follow these steps to create your installation directory on ```/usr/local/```.

#### Note that you could have done this before starting the installation process but I decided to engage you to create the installation directory now so you understand the steps and the difference between installing as root and installing just on the admin account. When you're installing as root, you are installing in the system hard drive in opposite to install in the admin account. Therefore, follow these steps below to create your installation directory.

- 1. Open a new terminal window and log as root again.
- 2. cd to the local directory and create your installation directory...

```[admin:~] root# cd /usr/local``` 

```[admin:/usr/local] root# mkdir apac```

#### After issuing these command as root, your directory will lock like this,

- 3. ``` /usr/local/apac```

#### I decided for the name ```apac``` for the installation directory but you can name it ```apache``` or any other name you like. After finishing this process, and have your installation directory in place, continue with the GUI installation by pressing ```next```.

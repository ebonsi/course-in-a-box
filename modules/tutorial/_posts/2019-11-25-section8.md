# Section 8 About the Software | The Apache Server

## The next software is nothing more than the resilient Apache Server. It also dispenses any commentary, you must use to appreciate its features.

#### [https://httpd.apache.org/](https://httpd.apache.org/)

#### The Apache Server can be installed through Webmin or by downloading a Mamp Package from Bitnami or through Homebrew.

#### We will cover the Bitnami package installation and configuration (as root) on port 80 and port 443. Note that I will be supplying a PDF file with the step-by-step images. The advantage of PDF file over the web is that you can enlarge the picture to see text and images without loosing it's sharpness.

#### The Mamp package comes with both Apache and MySQL and the installation of both can be done in one single shoot.

#### Before downloading the Mamp package, please take some time to prepare your hard drive so you will understand the structure configuration and storage of your new installation.

#### I am giving you an example to follow on the image below but you can create your own and do any way you want. You might think is too much but over time and dealing with software testing and installations you will be thankful to follow some type of organizational structure and you won't get lost looking for things when you upgrade in the future. Note that the directory structure of your installation will have from beginning to end...

#### Bitnami native installers automate the setup of a Bitnami application stack on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. Each installer includes all of the software necessary to run out of the box (the stack). The process is simple; just download, click next-next-next and you are done!

#### Try, test and work with the application in your local environment or as a root installation. Our installers are self contained. They don't interfere with other software on your system

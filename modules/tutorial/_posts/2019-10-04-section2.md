#### To start, to build a Server you should follow this guide and have this software installed on your system. During the course, I will go with you through the installation process. Later, we will advance to the configuration process.

### 2.a. But first, you should sign up for an (FQDN) Full Qualify Domain Name** of your choice! Choosing a domain name for yourself takes a little bit of thinking. My advice is that a domain should be short, comprehensive and easy to read and type. Domain extensions goes from .com, to .org, .net and beyond. What domain extension you will chose is up to you and your business of choice. Many times, the cost of the extension also play a role in deciding which one to signup for. Some are cheaper than others.

### 2.b. Choosing a Registrar, a (Domain Host) to host your domain.**

### 2.c. Example of Domain Host/Registrars.**

- #### Google Domain Host: [https://domains.google/](https://domains.google/)

- #### Name Domain Host: [https://www.name.com/](https://www.name.com/)

- #### Your Choice for Domain Hosting/Registrar

### 2.d. What a good Registrar (Domain Host) should provide.** 

- #### To start, the complete control over your domain through a GUI control panel

- #### Good email, phone support

- #### A tutorial to understand how the control panel GUI (Graphical User Interface) works.

- #### A fair price

## 3. BIND Server (If is not installed already, you will probably need to install it):

### **3a. Webmin (auxiliary companion to manage several visualization processes)**

### **3b. Terminal (Already installed in your system)**

### **3c. Network Stack (Already part of the Apple System Preferences)**

### **3d. Apache Server (If not installed, you will need to install it)**

#### If you for any reason could not sign in to Internet Society, I am advancing my list of Open Source Software plus some useful terminal commands I use on a daily basis for different tasks.

My number one software for network administration is Webmin. I think they also have a windows version.
01.0. Webmin, https://webmin.com/

My favor browser since the times of Netscape is Firefox/Mozilla. The reason I chose Firefox is not that it is trendy but because it is secure. Firefox was and I believe still is the only browser that allows you to lock the browser with your encrypted password. Something that I do not see in other browsers. You can get the common version like everybody else or you can get the developers version.
02.0. Common version: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
02.1. Developer's version: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/

For testing, I also use Google Chrome and Safari.

My third favor Browser is Tor. I do a lot research and testing with Tor. The internet browser Tor allow me to relay outside of my network and see my websites in real-time without being held up or deceived by the internal browser's cache. The other advantage, is being anonymous and not been followed by advertisers and other snoopers trying to follow you around the internet to steal your privacy and information. Therefore, for better privacy and security, you want to use TOR.
03.0. https://www.torproject.org

The other internal application I use every day is the Terminal. Even thou I can do many things using Webmin, I still use the Terminal for many tasks. Especially to test BIND.

My forth open-source software is BIND. BIND is so great that it dispense any of my observations about the software. If you are going to run a Web Server and Domains, it is essential to learn how to operate BIND. Berkeley Internet Name Daemon was Developed by the Internet Systems Consortium. Operating BIND by itself is fun, operating in combination with Webmin is fantastic.
04.0. https://www.isc.org/bind/

The fifth software is nothing but the resilient Apache Server. It also dispenses any commentary, you must use to appreciate its features.
05.0. https://httpd.apache.org/

The next open-source software, (kinda...) is MySQL. If you are going to do eCommerce and have a shopping cart for your services, products, and information, most of the shopping carts use MySQL, Maria DB is also another type of database. A great source for open source software is Bitnami, Bitnami MySQL/Apache. You just need to choose a package that is right for you. I will go with you to the Mac OS X installation process later.
06.0. https://bitnami.com/stacks

To manage your MySQL database, I use Sequel Pro. Much better than phpMyadmin that attracts all kinds of bozos on the internet looking to break in the application by attempting to find out any misconfiguration on your login window.
06.1. https://sequelpro.com/

My next is Letsencrypt and Certbot developed by the EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation. We have a lot to thank them for allowing a person to start their business online with no overhead expenses. You know that is impossible to have an eCommerce online shopping cart if you do not have encryption in your site. With encryption enabled, all that is possible.
07.0. https://letsencrypt.org
07.1 https://www.eff.org/

On the eCommerce side, In the past, I worked with Prestashop, I built an eCommerce store and I even did some translation for them. But at some point, they upgraded their software with a new code. As the code works out fine, the admin and store design interface left a lot to desire. Things that were there before, they decided to slice and sell. On top of that, their new installation was buggy. I am not saying is not good software and you should not be discouraged to test it. Maybe when they work out the compatibility installation issue, will get better. However, it does not compare with the previous interface design. But hey, if that work for you, fine. I prefer the Opencart.

Opencart claims to be the best free and open-source eCommerce platform. After testing, I can write down the same for you. I have tested their software and is great. The installation worked just fine. They give you several templates to get you going. You just have to read the installation manual and pay attention to the permissions on the installation phase.
08.0. https://www.opencart.com/

For text formatting, writing, spreadsheet, powerpoint presentations, I use Libre Office. LO become the greatest and solid software and we should thank them because, (if) was not for them, you would need to cough out 1,500 hundred dollars to Microsoft and accept the same lousy rules of these proprietary tech giants of upgrading and leaving people behind in the dust. The whole business world by now are using Libre Office and if they are not, oh well, they are making some room to justify some expenses. The Apache Foundation also has a version called Open Office. Just try both and see which one is more suitable for you.
09.0. https://www.libreoffice.org/
09.1. https://www.openoffice.org/

To watch the network, we cannot forget Wireshark. Wireshark got better during these years. It is very good to watch your network stacks and your router talk to each other. A great tool to observe how IPv6 talks on the network.
10.0. https://www.wireshark.org

On the Internal (LAN) and external (WAN) Network:
I also use tcpdump sometimes with the flags tcpdump -v or tcpdump -vv. Tcpdump is built into the Mac OS X and one can invoke from the Terminal. It seems that tcpdump translates directly from the DNS BIND activity.

10.1. Terminal [server:~] root# tcpdump
tcpdump -v
tcpdukm -vv

ifconfig is your everyday network stack watch. That is what I use to debug, design and build my network. ifconfig comes directly from your network stack; (wired) en0 and (wi-fi) en1.
10.2. Terminal [server:~] root# ifconfig

Netstat cannot stay out of your book, you sure are going to need it to find your router.
10.3. Terminal netstat
To find your router in the network:
[server:~] root# netstat -nr | grep 'default'

Other commands:
[server:~] root# netstat -r -f inet6
[server:~] root# netstat -Wan |grep 80
[server:~] root# netstat -Wan |grep 443
[server:~] root# netstat -r

Displaying your Routing Table:
[server:~] root# netstat -rn

To find your IPv6 Network;
[server:~] root# netstat -nr -f inet6

To test if a particular ip connects to the network you need to use ping. The right semantics to use ping goes as follows;
10.4. Terminal ping, Usage:

Wired Stack Interface en0
ping6 -n -I en0 [ipv6]

Wi-fi Stack Interface en1
ping6 -n -I en1 [ipv6]

ex:
[server:~] root# ping6 -n -I en1 2700:1800:c311:d2f0::3 <-- This ip is only an example! You must know what ip correspond to your network and use it to test if is connecting to the network.

Obs: To get out of the pinging session on the terminal, press Control + C

Pinging your Route:

[server:~] root# ping -R ns1.domain.com

You want to be able to work your internal and external resolvers. To find out what is there,
10.5. Terminal cat [path]
[server:~] root# cat /etc/resolv.conf

lsof is also great to find out what port is opened and what connections is hanging on in that port.
10.6. Terminal sudo lsof -i:[port]
[server:~] root# sudo lsof -i:80
[server:~] root# sudo lsof -i:443

From the Terminal console clear your ARP table to repopulate the list.
10.7. arp
[server:~] root#/usr/bin someuser$ arp -d -a

Dig is an essential tool of every network administrator to manage the BIND domain configurations. Dig works both in IPv4 and IPv6 without any extra specified command.
10.8. dig
Getting the forward zone
[server:~] root# dig A domain.com
[server:~] root# dig A 192.168.1.90
[server:~] root# dig AAAA domain.com

Getting the reverse Zone.
[server:~] root# dig -x 192.168.1.90

Web tools for Reverse IPv6 Zones: This is a great online tool to get your reverse IPv6. Unless you want to have a nightmare and pull your hair, use this tool.

For designing websites, I found this online editor to be great. If you know the code you can do anything.

As I said, I am passing you this list because I want to help you to install, debug and configure some of this software. On next posts, I will go through one-by-one explaining how to install and configure the ones that require a little more tasks. Some are easy and it is just a matter of downloading and install it, but some, you need to have some knowledge of the terminal of your present operating system file system hierarchy. I used to teach the Mac OS operating system at Skyline College. Some people would come to me expressing that they do not understand how the computer operates and want to learn more about. One of their first comments was; "-it seems complicated isn't?" ...and I used to tell people to ease their minds that the Mac OS was easy and based on your home/office file cabinet. You organize things in files and folders. Folders and Directories are two different words meaning the same thing.


#### **In this course, I will assist you through the main steps to install, configure and use this software.**

#### To start, to build a Server you should follow this guide and have this software installed on your system. During the course, I will go with you through the installation process. Later, we will advance to the configuration process.

### **2.a. But first, you should sign up for an (FQDN) Full Qualify Domain Name** of your choice! Choosing a domain name for yourself takes a little bit of thinking. My advice is that a domain should be short, comprehensive and easy to read and type. Domain extensions goes from .com, to .org, .net and beyond. What domain extension you will chose is up to you and your business of choice. Many times, the cost of the extension also play a role in deciding which one to signup for. Some are cheaper than others.

### **2.b. Choosing a Registrar, a (Domain Host) to host your domain.**

### **2.c. Example of Domain Host/Registrars.**

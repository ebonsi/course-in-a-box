#### Webmin is an administrative companion software for your Server. Webmin will help you visualize Bind, Apache and many other things in your server. There is one way to install Webmin and two ways to use it.

- #### one is as a localhost

- #### the other is with SSL configuration

#### Please, take your time to read more about Webmin on their website.

### The requirements to install Webmin on OS X can be found here with the title;
#### "Installing Webmin and Usermin on OS X". Do not install Usermin, it is not necessary for now.

#### Obs: Please, do not install anything else than it is required to operate Webmin. At a later time, you can get into testing all the software Webmin offers to you.

#### During your first time installing Webmin, it will ask you some questions. Most answers are just straight forward and you can just agree by pressing the return key. Just pay attention when you have to create your password. Most good passwords have characters, letters uppercase, and lowercase and numbers. Most passwords must have more than 8 digits. So make sure you have a book and to write down this information so you won't have problems remembering the login later. Take your time and do not rush through the steps. Read each step. We are not in a race to go nowhere. Like my father used to say, "Why are you rushing for, you are not going to take your father to the hospital!".

### When you first install Webmin, for security reasons, it will be directed to your computer localhost.
#### Most likely the address will be http://localhost:10000, port. At the end of the installation, Webmin will give you the address to login. When you are going to login, most browsers will give you a warning saying that the certificate is not valid. Do not worry about and go through the browsers security check. You will be connecting to your computer, so there is nothing to worry about.

#### Later then, we will configure Apache and your SSL Certificate of Authority for your domain, I will show you how to upload your Certificate (Cert) on Webmin so it will communicate directly to your server domain through the 'https://" protocol.
